Hi, this is a beginner project for Arduino Uno, it's basically a thermometer with other functions like fire detection and other that will be implemented.
I'm not also a good programmer so if my program is not so good and optimized I apologize.

For this Arduino project you will need:
  x1 Arduino Uno Board
  x1 Breadboard
  1x 100k NTC Thermistor
  1x Active Buzzer
  3x 330 Ohm Resistors
  xN As much jumpers as you want
  
Thanks for visiting this repo.
See you soon for other projects!
